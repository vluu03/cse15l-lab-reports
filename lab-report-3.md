# Lab Report 3

For this lab report, I will be finding and showcasing some command-line options for the ```grep``` command in bash, and it will be used on the ```./written_2``` data repository.

## Command-Line Options for ```grep```

For this lab report I will be showing the following command-line options:

* ```grep -q //Only returns 0 or 1 depending whether or not there is a match with the string or pattern```
* ```grep -c //Shows only the count the lines with the string or pattern```
* ```grep -r //Recursivly search for the string or pattern in all the subdirectories of the current directory```
* ```grep -n //Shows the line number of the string or pattern within the file```

I learned about these commands on this [website](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/grep.1.html)
